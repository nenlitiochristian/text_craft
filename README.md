# text_craft
text_craft is a simple Rust project I started to practice writing Rust code. This project is primarily intended for educational purposes and is not designed to be a compelling game.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Became familiar with the borrow checker.
- Learned about cool features like Result, Option, match, etc. I particularly liked the way Rust handles errors with Results compared to Java's Exceptions.
- Explored the concepts of structs, modules, and basic Cargo usage.
- Gained knowledge of file handling in Rust.
