# text_craft
text_craft is a simple Rust project I started to practice writing rust. This project is primarily intended for educational purposes and is not designed to be a compelling game.

Key Learning Points:
- Got familiar with the borrow checker.
- Learnt cool features like Result, Option, match, etc. I really like the Result way of handling errors compared to Java's Exceptions.
- Learnt about structs, modules, and basic cargo usage.
- Learnt some file handling.
